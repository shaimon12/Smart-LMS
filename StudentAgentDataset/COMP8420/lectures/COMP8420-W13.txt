“Generative agents are believable 
simulacra of human behavior for 
interactive applications. In this work, 
we demonstrate generative agents by 
populating a sandbox environment, 
reminiscent of The Sims, with twenty-
five agents. Users can observe and 
intervene as agents plan their days, 
share news, form relationships, and 
coordinate group activities.”
