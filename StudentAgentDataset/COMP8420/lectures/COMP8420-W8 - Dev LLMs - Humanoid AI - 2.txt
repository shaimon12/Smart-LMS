Functional vs nonfunctional 
•
Functional humanoid: 
Functional specifications of 
human-like and lifelike 
humanoids define and enable 
how an AI humanoid look like, 
what it does, and how it 
implements its purposes, tasks, 
and operations, etc. They 
determine what humanoid 
structures, senses, behaviors 
and functions to implement and 
operate
•
Nonfunctional humanoid: 
safe and secure in their 
operations and action-taking; 
trustful and responsible for 
their actions; transparent and 
explainable in their outputs; 
empathetic and rational during 
teaming, collaboration and 
interaction; and compliant, legal 
and ethical for integrity and 
regulation
