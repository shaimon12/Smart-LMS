Background Data
• Emergency Department 
(ED) faces significant 
challenges due to 
increased patient volumes 
and human resource 
constraints.
• This critical imbalance 
often causes overcrowded 
and delayed treatment, 
triggering higher rates of 
morbidity and mortality.

Objectives
• We aim to build an LLM-based multi-agent system to 
automate conversation, information extraction, and triage 
assignment in the ED workflow.
• We seek to evaluate the performance of LLMs across 
these critical tasks.
Design Principles
• Grounded in Reality
• Workflow-Aligned Design
• Customized Agents
• Integrating External Knowledge (if applicable)

Experiments (Motivation)
• How effectively can LLMs extract critical patient 
information during the conversations?
• What level of accuracy can LLMs achieve when assigning 
proper triage categories to patients?
Experiments (Setup)
• Dataset: We construct a dataset based on triage scenarios 
published in Emergency Triage Education Kit, involving 132 
samples with triage categories assigned by medical experts. 
• Preprocess: To tailor the dataset for our experiments, we used 
GPT-4o to structure the scenarios into specific fields*:
1. Basic_info includes standard personal information, like name, age, and 
gender.
2. Clinic_info usually involves longer and more complex information, 
including the patient’s primary concerns and associated symptoms. 
   
* Two proficient English-speaking annotators then independently review these assignments in a back-to-back manner.

Summary
• We developed HEAL, an LLM-based assistant system that automates 
and optimizes triage processes in Emergency Departments.
• We designed a multi-agent architecture where each LLM agent fulfills a 
specific role, powered by our custom-built Profiling, Memory, Action, 
and Knowledge Modules.
• We validated HEAL’s effectiveness in information extraction and triage 
classification, with GPT-4o mini delivering the best overall performance.
Future Work
• Multi-modality: Explore the integration of different types of data 
beyond text, such as image analysis (e.g., photos of injuries)
• Sensor Integration: Leverage smart personal wearables (like Apple 
Watch) and other medical sensors to gather real-time physiological 
data
• Real-World Pilot Studies and Clinical Validation: Conduct pilot 
studies in actual Emergency Department environments to evaluate 
HEAL's performance, usability, and impact on key metrics like waiting 
times, staff workload, and patient satisfaction
