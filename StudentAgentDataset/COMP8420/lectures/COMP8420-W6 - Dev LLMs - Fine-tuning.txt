There is a patient with these symptoms: fever, cough, and fatigue. The doctors may employ abductive 
reasoning to reach a potential diagnosis. They might consider various hypotheses, such as a common cold, 
influenza, or pneumonia. They evaluate the available evidence, including the patient’s medical history, 
physical examination, and any lab tests. By analyzing the symptoms and considering the most likely 
explanation, the doctors abductively reason towards a diagnosis that best fits the observed data.

• Knowledge/model distillation
•
Transfer knowledge from teacher to 
student, replicate outputs and emulate 
thought/reasoning processes
•
Knowledge: parameters, input-output 
mapping relationships, reasoning 
processes
•
A teacher/large model: large, pretrained 
with soft targets, probabilities or logits 
(not hard targets/labels)
•
A student/small/distilled model: 
smaller, more efficient to mimic teacher 
predictions with soft targets for training
•
Compress and transfer knowledge from 
the teacher to the student (correct 
answers, relationships etc in teacher)
•
Same or improved learning performance 
(better generalization)
•
More efficient (smaller size, less complex, 
faster inference/training, deployment)
•
Privacy-preserving (no original training 
data but transfer set)

• Knowledge/model distillation
• Structure, process and impact
•
Offline distillation: fixed teacher 
model
•
Online distillation: simultaneously 
train teacher and student
•
Self-distillation: transfer from 
deeper layers to shallow layers

• LLMs
• Multilingual LLMs: multiple 
teachers/languages for a 
student, cotraining 
languages for similar 
embeddings
• Dataset generation for 
instruction tuning of 
student: Orca from GPT-4
• Rank and augment student:
