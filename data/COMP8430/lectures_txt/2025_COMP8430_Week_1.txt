Fundamental Concepts in Computer Vision
Introduction to Computer Vision:
Computer vision involves the development of algorithms and
techniques for interpreting and understanding visual data from the
real world. It encompasses various tasks such as image
classification, object detection, segmentation, and scene
understanding.
Components
Machine Learning (ML)
--- Learn from data & predicts w/o being explicitly programmed
Deep Learning (DL)
--- Subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural
networks
Computer Vision (CV)
--- Perceive & understand visual information from images/videos
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
--- Understand, interpret, and generate human language
CV
NLP
Question: what can be achieved with the components?
Fundamental Concepts in Computer Vision
Image Representation and Processing:
Images are represented as arrays of pixel values. Basic operations
include resizing, cropping, rotating, and filtering images using
techniques like convolution and smoothing. Color spaces such as
RGB, HSV, and grayscale are also fundamental concepts.
Is it necessary?
Fundamental Concepts in Computer Vision
Feature Extraction:
Feature extraction involves identifying informative characteristics
from images that can be used for further analysis. Common
techniques include edge detection, corner detection, and feature
descriptors like SIFT, SURF, and ORB.
What is desirable feature?
Fundamental Concepts in Computer Vision
Image Classification:
Image classification is the task of assigning labels or categories to
images based on their visual content. Traditional approaches
include machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines
(SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and decision trees. Deep
learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), have revolutionized image classification in recent years.
Is it an easy task?
Fundamental Concepts in Computer Vision
Object Detection and Localization:
Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within
images. Techniques such as sliding window-based methods, region-
based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), and single-shot
detectors (SSD) are commonly used for this task.
Question
What to know in the very beginning for computer vision?
Image Enhancement
1.1 What is image enhancement?
--- Modify the intensities of pixels in an image so that it can be
more suitable for a specific application.
Different enhancement process suits different application.
An enhancement method is good for an application but maybe bad
for another application.
1. Introduction
Question: Is image enhancement related to advance CV?
Image Enhancement
1.2 Categories of methods for enhancement process.
Spatial domain: process pixels in the image plane directly.
Frequency domain: modify the Fourier transform of an image.
Yes! Low level vision – image denoising, super resolution. Key for
CNN!
Image Enhancement
Mathematically, the enhancement process in the spatial domain can
be described by the transform function
g(x,y) = T [f(x,y)]
𝑓(x,y) --- input image,
g(x,y) --- output image,
T --- a transform
For a single pixel, we have: s = T (r)
r --- grey-level value for an input pixel
s --- grey-level value for an output pixel
 
Image Enhancement

We use a graph to denote the transform function s = T (r) .

2. Transformations
2.1. Image negatives
Image Enhancement
2.2. Contrast stretching
For a low-contrast image, we feel it uncomfortable and sometimes
can not see details clearly.
Image Enhancement
Mathematically, We have following transform for stretching
contrast.
Image Enhancement
3. Filtering
Removing or intensifying some components in an image by using
enhancement processing is called filtering.
Using spatial masks to process an image is called spatial filtering
Using the Fourier transform to process an image is called Frequency
domain filtering.
Image Enhancement
3.1. Mask
Applying a mask to an image is a basic concept in image processing
– convolution.
(1) What is a mask: A mask is a set of pixel positions with values
called weights. A 3x3 mask is as follows.

For any point (x,y) in the image, align the center of the mask to it.
We have

Question
What else to know about start a computer vision project?
Basic Concepts
Data collection & processing
Training a model with the input data
Training loss
Error metrics
Tensor
Vector: 1D array
Matrix: 2D array
Tensor: an array with any number of dimensions
Rank: number of dimensions
Example: A matrix with 12 rows and 18 columns has a shape of (12,
18) and a rank of 2.
What is the size/dimension of an input image?
Output of classification model
Probability (p) --- the likelihood that an event will occur over many
trials.
Odds --- the probability of the event occurring divided by the
probability of it not occurring, p/(1-p)
Logit (log(p/1-p)) --- the natural logarithm of the odds of the event
happening.
Sigmoid 𝜎𝑌=𝑝 --- the inverse of the logit function.
𝜎𝑌=11+𝑒−𝑌
 
What is the sigmoid output range?
Try to derive from sigmoid to logit?
Output of classification model
Softmax --- multiclass counterpart of the sigmoid. Given N mutually
exclusive events, their logits are 𝑌𝑗, then softmax(𝑌𝑗 ) provides the
probability of the jth event.
S𝑌𝑗=𝑒−𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑒−𝑌𝑗
The softmax function is nonlinear and has the effect of squashing
low values and boosting the maximum.
 
Training Loss for Classification
Cross Entropy --- Compare the output probability (𝑝𝑗 for the jth
class) of the model against the true label for that class (𝐿𝑗) and sum
this up over all the classes using the formula.
𝑗(−𝐿𝑗log⁡(𝑝𝑗)) 
If the model gets it exactly correct, this probability will be
log(1)=0, so the loss is 0; if the model gets it exactly wrong, the
probability will be 0, log(0) is –infinity, so the loss is +infinity, the
worst possible loss.
 
Error metrics
Accuracy --- simply the fraction of instances that are classified
correctly
Precision --- the fraction of true positives in the set of identified
positives: TP/(TP+FP).
Recall --- the fraction of true positives among all the positives in the
dataset: TP/(TP+FN).
F1 --- 2/[1/precision + 1/recall]
