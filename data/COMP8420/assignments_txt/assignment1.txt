COMP8420 2025 S1 Assignment 1 (Text Classification)
Qiongkai Xu (qiongkai.xu@mq.edu.au)
Due: Tuesday March 18th 2025 (Week 4)
This assignment assesses the following unit learning outcomes:
• ULO1: Compare and evaluate the key natural language processing applications that
meet the current and emerging industry needs.
• ULO2: Explain the main techniques that are used to develop and implement natural
language processing applications.
• ULO3: Implement natural language processing applications using common tools and
libraries used in industry.
• ULO4: Design natural language processing applications using advanced deep learning
techniques.
It is expected that students will need approximately 30 to 40 hours to com-
plete the project individually.
It accounts for 30% of the overall assessment for this unit.
Start this assignment as soon as possible! Attend most of our lecturers and workshops to
find hints for the assignment. Make (even tiny) pieces of progress every week. If you leave
this project until the last minute, you won’t have enough time to complete it, even if you
can program at 1000 lines per hour and you have a server with 100 GPUs.

Essential Timeline:
• Release Date: Week 1 Lecture (Feb 28th 2025)
• Due Date: Week 4 (Tuesday March 18th 2025)

Introduction
Assignment 1 invites you to assist lecturers in developing analytical tools to classify human-
or machine-generated texts. Unfortunately, your lecturers (playing a role as a less reliable
boss in the future) only have the idea in mind but there is no data yet for this project.
You are expected to tackle the challenge from scratch by developing a pipeline. Your tasks
include:
1. collecting a suitable dataset for this purpose;
2. developing visualization and/or analytical tools;
3. reporting your methodologies and the results.
2
Data Collection
Since no data is currently available for the project, you must devise a strategy to collect
an appropriate dataset. Keep in mind that the goal is to classify texts as either human- or
machine-generated, so you will need two distinct sets of documents or texts. Additionally, to
perform the classification task, each text must be labelled appropriately (for example, using
‘0’ for human-generated texts and ‘1’ for machine-generated texts).
Rubric [maximum 8 marks]:
• Reusing a publicly available dataset [4 marks] or Collecting a proprietary dataset [6
marks]
• Data splitting [2 marks]
Note: Deductions may apply if errors occur during the data collection process.

Data Analysis
The first task is to provide an intuitive explanation on what distinguishes these two classes.
To accomplish this, you are required to (1) use NLP techniques such as tokenization and
n-gram to extract features from the texts; (2) implement a statistical model (for example, a
logistic regression classifier); (3) demonstrate the significance of the extracted features; and
(4) convincingly present your findings to your evaluators (or, in the future, your boss).
2
Rubric [maximum 8 marks]:
• Feature extraction [2 marks]: Either one-hot and tf-idf approaches are acceptable for
full marks here; however, using both will provide you with more experiments to discuss
in the next two questions.
• Statistical classifier [2 marks]: Correctly implementing logistic regression (or other
more advanced statistical classifiers) with reasonable performance will be worth full
marks here.
• Comparison [2 marks]: Comparing different settings of your experiments, e.g., varying
features, classifiers or datasets. One mark for each comparison experiment.
• Analysis and report [2 marks]: Full marks can be earned by analysing your classifier’s
weights to identify the key factors or features.
Note 1: Deductions may apply if errors occur during the data analysis process.
Note 2: You may consider skipping this section if you are short on time.

Deep Learning-Based Classification
In this task, you will develop a classifier using deep learning techniques. Your objectives are
to (1) train (2) validate and (3) test your classifier based on your dataset.
Rubric [maximum 14 marks]:
• Classifier Setup [2 Marks]: Initialize and configure your deep learning model correctly.
• Validation Set Usage [2 Marks]: Properly integrate a validation set to guide model
development and tuning.
• Training Process [2 Marks]: Execute a comprehensive training process and clearly
document the procedure.
• Performance Demonstration [2 Marks]: Present detailed metrics and outcomes that
reflect your model’s performance.
• Method Analysis [2 Marks]: Provide a thorough discussion on the strengths and weak-
nesses of your approach.
• Report and Code Clarity [2 Marks]: Ensure that both your report and code are well-
organized and easy to understand.
• Model and Hyperparameter Comparison [2 Marks]: Compare multiple models or dif-
ferent hyperparameter configurations to justify your choices.
Note 1: Deductions may apply if errors occur during the data analysis process.
Note 2: You are permitted to use pre-trained language models as a foundation to expedite
training. Note 3: Given its high impact on your overall score, allocate sufficient time and
effort to this task.

Advancing Your Project
You have the opportunity to earn an additional 0.5 to 3 bonus points — and possibly even
a complimentary cup of coffee from Qiongkai — by excelling in the following areas:
• Developing a comprehensive dataset that demonstrates strong potential for use in
related research.
• Proposing an innovative solution that could significantly influence and drive forward
the research field.
• Showcasing robust generalization capabilities, such as supporting multiple languages,
accommodating diverse user groups, or integrating various generative models.
Note: The total assignment score is capped at 30 points.

Submission
You are required to submit a Python Jupyter Notebook to iLearn for marking. The notebook
should contain three clear sections, (1) Dataset, (2) Data Analysis and (3) Classification.
Both runnable code and explanation should be provided in the notebook. If you have col-
lected a proprietary dataset (presumably less than 5 MB), you can submit it as well.

Notes
Should I use PyTorch or TensorFlow?
Both frameworks are acceptable for our as-
signments. Please choose the one with which you are most comfortable at the moment. In
alignment with our workshop settings, we highly encourage you to become familiar with
PyTorch as soon as possible.
Can I use other tools in my assignments?
In general, any publicly available Python
package is permitted. However, you must clearly specify the tools and libraries you utilize
in your assignment.
Can I reuse previous projects or assignments from other units (e.g., COMP3420)?
It’s allowed to reuse code pieces from other units, but please note that a simplistic approach
won’t solve the whole problem or earn you high marks. It’s encouraged to develop a fresh
project and solution.
Can I use materials from workshops?
Absolutely. You are encouraged to apply, mod-
ify, and implement any tools introduced during our workshops. Keep in mind, though, that
simply copying and pasting code will not result in a satisfactory solution—your understand-
ing of the concepts and techniques is crucial and will significantly influence your score.

What is the collaboration policy?
This assignment must be completed individually,
and each student is required to submit their own work via iLearn. While discussing ideas
with classmates is permitted, your final submission must be entirely your own work.

Policy
Late Submission Policy:
For both assignments and the major project, NO late sub-
mission policy applies, unless Special Consideration has been submitted and approved. All
deadlines mean 11:59:59 pm that day.
Special Consideration Policy:
The Special Consideration Policy aims to support stu-
dents who have been impacted by short-term circumstances or events that are serious, un-
avoidable and significantly disruptive, and which may affect their performance in assessment.
If you experience circumstances or events that affect your ability to complete the assessments
in this unit on time, please inform the convenor and submit a Special Consideration request
through ask.mq.edu.au.
