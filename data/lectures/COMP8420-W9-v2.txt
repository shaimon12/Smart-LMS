Part-of-Speech (POS)
A word’s POS tells us a lot about the word and its neighbours
• limits the range of meanings (deal [n] vs. deal [v])
• impacts pronunciations (object [AWBject] [N] vs object [obJECT] [V])
• helps in lemmatisation (finding the root)
generalisations [n] → generalisation [n] → generalise [v] → general [adj]
running [v] → run [v] (e.g. running home)
running [adj] → running [adj] (e.g. running order)
• limits the range of following words for automated speech recognition
and optical character recognition
• helps select key information (e.g., nouns) from a document for IR or text 
similarity

Syntax Trees
Syntactic relations are usually represented in a tree structure that captures the 
structure of a sentence. It identifies the POS of each word, and how the words 
group into syntactic constituents.

Dependency Trees
A Dependency Grammar is an alternative representation of syntactic structure 
which directly tries to capture syntactic relationships between words (rather than 
between categories). Words are linked by binary asymmetric relations called 
“dependencies”, because there is a notion of heads and dependents.
